### MS Visual Studio

In the **\cmake\win64** folder there are a couple of batch files that will set up Visual Studio solution files (for those that want them). These batch files will set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to a directory in the source tree rather than using the default (C:\\Program Files\\) location.
